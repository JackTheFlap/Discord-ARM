# Discord-ARM
Discord-ARM is an Electron wrapper for https://discord.com/app which has been built for Apple Silicon (arm64). 

## Discord-ARM VS Official macOS Discord
Discord-ARM was created due to issues with running the official macOS Discord application using Rosetta 2. 

Discord-ARM runs the web version of Discord (https://discord.com/app). This means desktop exclusive features such as custom keybinds and screen sharing will not work with Discord-ARM.

## Download
Pre-built binaries can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/JackTheFlap/Discord-ARM/releases).

## Build
To build run ```./build.sh``` if Discord-ARM has not been built before the script will prompt to install electron-packager.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute please branch off of the development branch and open pull requests against it rather than master. Otherwise just try to stick to the general style of the code.
